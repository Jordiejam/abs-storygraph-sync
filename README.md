# abs-storygraph-sync

Automatically syncs your [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) listening progress to [StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/).

Runs as a lightweight Docker container alongside ABS. No browser automation — uses the ABS REST API and StoryGraph session cookies directly. Supports multiple people sharing one instance, each with their own ABS/StoryGraph credentials.

## Features

- Multi-user: everyone gets their own account, ABS/StoryGraph credentials, and sync state
- Login via local username/password, or SSO through any OIDC provider (e.g. [PocketID](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id))
- Auto-syncs progress whenever you've listened to 5+ new minutes of a book
- Configurable sync scope: just in-progress books, in-progress + finished, or your entire library
- Web UI to manage credentials, view logs, and trigger a manual sync
- Progress is only pushed to StoryGraph when it actually changes (no duplicate journal entries)
- Matches the closest audiobook edition using ISBN/ASIN when available and the ABS runtime
- Accounts, settings, and sync state persist across restarts

## Setup

### 1. Run with Docker Compose

Clone this fork and check out the edition-aware matcher branch:

```sh
git clone --branch feature/edition-aware-matcher https://github.com/Jordiejam/abs-storygraph-sync.git
cd abs-storygraph-sync
```

```yaml
services:
  abs-storygraph-sync:
    build: .
    image: abs-storygraph-sync:local
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${WEB_PORT:-5465}:5465"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      PORT: "5465"
      # Optional: enable "Sign in with SSO" for any OIDC provider (e.g. PocketID)
      # OIDC_ISSUER: https://id.example.com
      # OIDC_CLIENT_ID: your_client_id
      # OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET: your_client_secret
```

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://your-server:5465** — the first visit prompts you to create an account, which becomes an admin. Admins can add more local accounts from the **Users** panel; anyone who signs in via SSO gets an account automatically on first login.

The ABS URL depends on how the two services can reach each other:

| Setup | Example ABS URL |
|---|---|
| Same Docker network | `http://audiobookshelf:80` |
| Docker Desktop, using ABS's published port | `http://host.docker.internal:13378` |
| ABS elsewhere on your LAN | `http://192.168.1.20:13378` |
| Public/reverse-proxied ABS | `https://abs.example.com` |

Use the actual Audiobookshelf service name, internal port, host address, and
published port from your deployment. Normal bridge networking and a published
web port are used so the sync service works across Linux and Docker Desktop.

### 2. Get your ABS API token

In Audiobookshelf: **Settings → Users → your user → API Token**

### 3. Get your StoryGraph session cookies

1. Log in to [app.thestorygraph.com](https://app.thestorygraph.com) in your browser
2. Open DevTools → **Application** → **Cookies** → `app.thestorygraph.com`
3. Copy the values for:
   - `_storygraph_session`
   - `remember_user_token`

### 4. Enter your credentials

Paste your ABS URL/token and StoryGraph cookies into the **Settings** card in the web UI (each account has its own). Optionally set the **Sync Scope** there too — see below.

## Configuration

Instance-wide environment variables (set once by whoever deploys the container):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `5465` | Port for the web UI |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | `600` | How often to check for new progress (seconds) |
| `SYNC_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` | `5` | Minimum new minutes listened before triggering a sync |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | *(unset)* | Base URL of your OIDC provider (must expose `/.well-known/openid-configuration`) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | *(unset)* | OIDC client ID |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(unset)* | OIDC client secret |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | *(unset)* | Externally-visible base URL, e.g. `https://abs-sync.example.com` (no trailing slash). Only needed if auto-detection below doesn't work for your setup |

Everything else — ABS credentials, StoryGraph cookies, sync scope — is per-user, set through the web UI, no restart needed.

### OIDC redirect URI

When registering this app with your OIDC/OAuth provider (Google, PocketID, etc.), the redirect URI to configure is:

```
https://your-domain.example.com/auth/callback
```

The app is behind a plain HTTP `python app.py` process, so if you're reverse-proxying it over HTTPS (Caddy, nginx, Traefik, ...), it needs to know the request actually arrived over HTTPS in order to generate that redirect URI correctly when it talks to the provider — otherwise it'll send an `http://` redirect URI even though your proxy terminates TLS, and the provider will reject it as a mismatch. This is handled automatically as long as your reverse proxy forwards the standard `X-Forwarded-Proto`/`X-Forwarded-Host` headers (Caddy's `reverse_proxy` does this by default; other proxies may need it configured explicitly). If auto-detection still isn't giving the right URL for your setup, set `PUBLIC_URL` to force it.

## Sync scope

Each user picks how much of their library to sync, in **Settings**:

- **In Progress** (default) — only books you're currently listening to
- **+ Finished** — the above, plus books you've completed (marked "read" on StoryGraph)
- **Entire Library** — every book, including ones you haven't started (marked "to-read" on StoryGraph)

## How it works

1. Every `POLL_INTERVAL` seconds, fetches each user's books from the ABS API (scoped per their Sync Scope setting)
2. If any book has gained `SYNC_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` or more minutes since the last check, or has just been finished, it triggers a sync
3. For each book to sync, searches StoryGraph by title/author, inspects that work's editions, and selects an audio edition by exact ISBN/ASIN or closest runtime
4. Progress/status is only pushed if it actually changed since the last successful sync, preventing duplicate reading journal entries

If no audio edition is within a conservative runtime tolerance, the sync leaves the book untouched rather than risk writing progress to the wrong edition. Successful edition choices are persisted against the stable Audiobookshelf item ID and reused on later syncs.

StoryGraph has no public API — this tool uses session cookies to make the same requests the website does.

> **⚠️ Fragility warning:** Because this tool reverse-engineers StoryGraph's internal, unpublished web endpoints, it is inherently brittle. Any change StoryGraph makes to their HTML structure, URL routes, CSRF handling, or cookie behaviour can break the sync without warning and with no recourse. There is no official API to fall back on.

## Session cookie expiry

StoryGraph session cookies expire periodically. When the sync stops working, grab fresh cookies from your browser (step 2 above) and paste them into the **Settings** tab of the web UI.
